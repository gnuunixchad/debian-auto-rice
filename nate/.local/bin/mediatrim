# trim the first and last seconds of a audio/video file
# triming a mp4 file with ffmpeg could make it non-streamable
# fix it by copy the movflags of the orgianl file
# ffmpeg -i output.mp4 -c copy -movflags faststart new_output.mp4

# put $1 inside quotation marks so the special characters in the filename wouldn't be meaningful to bash
