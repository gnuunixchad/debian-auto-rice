# read from bookmarks file, print the selection address stdout then copy to clipboard

# `grep -vE "^#|^[[:space:]]*$"` filters any line starting with `#` or only contains spaces/tabs, before piping to dmenu.

# `awk '{sub(/[^|]*\|/, ""); print}'` run the sub function sub(), using regex to replace any sequence of characters that does not contain pipe symbol followed by a pipe symbol to empty chracter, then print the modified string. This filters the bookmarks' comments before piping to tee and copy to clipboard.

# `tee >(xsel -b)` print the input to standard output before piping to xsel, in case this script is running in a terminal

# increase delay to reduce characters missing

# copy the selection to clipboard
